# EBI Pattern library
This documents and [demonstrates](https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Pattern-library/) patterns for the [EBI Visual framework](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework).

## How to use?

This is a collaborative effort. The pattern library exsists because of cross collaboration with teams across EMBL-EBI.

### Use the pattern library for guidance
Check out the source code of [patterns in the libary](https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Pattern-library/patterns/index).

### Making your own pattern library
Fork this repo or create a sub- or super-set of pattern functionality, and add colors and components in their respective directories.

The easiest way to see the changes is to view through Github Pages, alternatively you can build the Jekyll on your local [machine](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).

### Contribute a pattern back to us
If you'd like to create a new pattern, just share the link to the pattern in your library, or [submit a new pattern with this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kNXJ4Sj5_iPgqdXPgt9xNPvS53io5znWDch7sw58Sqg/edit?usp=sharing).
