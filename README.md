# EBI Pattern Library
This documents and [demonstrates](https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Pattern-library/) patterns for the EBI Visual framework.

## How to use?

### To develop a website
Look at the code snippets in the browser or the code chunks in /colors and /components (more to do here...)

### Making your own pattern library
If you need to fork your own variant of the EBI Pattern library or, as recommended, create a sub- or super-set of pattern functionality, fork this repo and add colors and components in their respective directories.

The easiest way to see the changes is to view through Github Pages, alternatively you can build the Jekyll on your local [machine](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).
