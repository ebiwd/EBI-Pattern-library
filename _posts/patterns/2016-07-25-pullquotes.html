<div class="row">
  <div class="columns medium-6">
    <p>As needs vary, we have designed three basic variations.</p>

    <blockquote class="">
      A pretty basic thing to say: I once was a child.
    </blockquote>

    <p>You can enhance it by adding class <code>.lead</code> and the size will grow and the line drop:</p>

    <blockquote class="lead">
      A slightly more interesting thing to say: I once was a squirrel.
    </blockquote>

    <p>And for added emphasis you can add a left quotation mark with <code>.quote</code>, and even a splash of colour:</p>

    <blockquote class="lead quote industry-color">
      You can't be friends with a squirrel! A squirrel is just a rat with a cuter outfit. <cite>Sarah Jessica Parker</cite>
    </blockquote>
