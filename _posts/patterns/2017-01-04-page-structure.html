<p>This structure is informed by a large amount of UX research, team feedback, and tweaked to be compliant with the EMBL and EMBL-EBI branding.
In short: using the boilerplate formats will help save you time, deliver a better experience to the users and keep the branding watchdogs happier. </p>

<h3>What is the structure?</h3>
<ol>
  The page is divided into three major areas:
  <li>Centrally governed structure: where content and structure are managed by EMBL-EBI (global masthead and global footer);</li>
  <li>Structured with custom content: where content managed by a service, and the structure is managed by EMBL-EBI (local masthead and local footer); and</li>
  <li>Custom: where content and structure is governed by the service with guidance from the pattern library[add link] (breadcrumb, main content, relationships).</li>
</ol>
