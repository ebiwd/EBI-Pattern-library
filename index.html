<p class="lead">This is a "living guide" that implements a broad range of interface items using the the <a href="https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework">EBI Visual Framework</a>. Use this as a guide on how you should make your page elements look and function.</p>

<p>Go on: check out some of the patterns on the <<< left. Or, keep reading to learn more about the background of the pattern libary.</p>

<h3>About the Framework</h3>
<p>The framework is a collection of JS, CSS, icons, coding conventions, and templated components that will help you build robust web content faster than if you were to make it from scratch.</p>

This page offers guidance on building web site, pages, and content that comply with the EMBL-EBI: visual look and semantic structure.

  <h4>How to use this</h4>

    Do as I do, not as I say.

  </blockquote>

  <p>Read the information below for context and use the menu to the left to view patterns.</p>

  <p>This guide does not offer prescriptive solutions for every scenario, but integrates a wide range of pull quotes, form boxes, menus, and more to show you how things should be done.</p>
  <p>Also <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/global.html">consult the Foundation 6 docs <i class="icon icon-generic" data-icon="x"></i></a>, as this framework leverages that toolset.</p>
  <p>If you have questions you can't find the answeres to, <a href="#help">see the help section</a>.</p>

  <h3>Implementing the framework</h3>
  <p>There are two likely scenarios:</p>

    <dt>Updating an existing site?</dt>
    <dd><p>If you're updating an EBI Compliance theme site, you'll just need to replace a few JS/CSS files, change some layout classes, and make minore tweaks. It could take as little as 30 minutes. <a href="https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework/blob/gh-pages/sample-site/migrations/testMigration.js" class="readmore">Run your own sample auto-migration</a></p></dd>

  <h3>Requirements and what you get</h3>
  <p>The framework is built with modern best practices and targets browsers shipped within the past three years; though other browsers should still handle the content and appearance well (graceful degradation). The framework is also mobile responsive (Responsive Web Design), so you won't have to spend too much time adapting for mobile.</p>

  <p>To help us help you, we've used the Foundation Framework (version 6) as a baseline. Using this we get a robust set of web components (tool tips, forms, sliders, and modal boxes) as well as technical guidance and extensive open source community testing -- and, perhaps, you'll be fortunate enough to already have a developer with experience with Foundation.</p>

  <p>We've taken care to make the implementation non-intrusive, so if you don't want to use these features, they won't likely get in your way.</p>

  <p>The easiest way to implement the style guide is to <a href="https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Pattern-library/sample-site/">download the EBI boilerplate</a> - use those HTML files as a template for your own pages. It contains the HTML for the EBI header and footer and place holders for your project name / logo and page content. It also links to the core stylesheets you'll need to make your web pages look like part of the EBI website.</p>

  <h3>Framework components</h3>
  <p>This framework functions similar to many front-end solutions: several files and structures are used and generally can be implemented seperately so you can use what you can or your own solution if required. We also leverage a NPM build process so there's no need to use all of the Foundation framework, if you don't need it.</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <ol>
      <li>Core HTML structure: The basic HTML markup structure for the page: global-nav black bar, local-nav area, main content div, footer, etc.</li>
      <li><a href="css/ebi-global.css">EBI base CSS styles</a>: Our basic look/colours.</li>
      <li><a href="https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Framework/libraries/foundation-6/css/foundation.css">Foundation base CSS styles</a>: this provides the base grid structure, style resets, and core structure of the page.</li>
      <li><a href="css/theme-embl-petrol.css">Your site's CSS colours</a>: Colours specific to your service/site.</li>
      <li>Fonts.css</li>
      <li>jQuery 1.10.2: Slightly older versions may be compatible.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Foundation JS</li>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://ebiwd.github.io/EBI-Framework/js/foundationExtendEBI.js">EBI JS tweaks to Foundation</a>: A series of value adds that build atop Foundation.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      <li>EBI JS</li>
      <li>Cookie JS</li>
      <li>Footer JS</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>In short: add header markup, footer markup, CSS and JS. Then add content.</p>

  <h3>FAQs</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>JavaScript:</dt>
      <dd><p>The framework does not require jQuery, but if you do use it you will get more nice to haves and your life may be easier all around. The jQuery functionality is enable by default. For more see the section on disabling JavaScript addons (you'll comment out two lines -- need to write this...)</p></dd>
    <dt>Foundation:</dt>
      <dd><p>If you aren't able to use the included Foundation base CSS, we do provide some support for other frameworks (such as Bootstrap), but we've picked Foundation as the "recommended implementation" as it offers a path for more graceful integration of EBI styles and requirements.</p>
      <p>If you're unable to make use of the Frameworks JS or CSS tooling, use this page as a guide for how your site should look, feel, function. There's no reason that can't be done with any framework be it Angular, Material Design, or vanilla CSS3.</p>
      <p>For new websites or major reworks, we recommend you consider using the included Foundation CSS and JS, as you'll get more benefit from the work done in this framework, encounter fewer bugs, and help EBI web services have a more consistent function and feel.</p>
      </dd>
    <dt>Bootstrap:</dt>
      <dd><p>While the front-end framework provides a robust set of tooling and a broader use base, its base styling is more opinionated (121KB vs 43KB of minified baseline CSS). Foundation allows us to provide a slimmer and faster EBI theme layer. Further, non-jQuery using developers will find more benefit in a Foundation-powered ecosystem. For Bootstrap users unfamiliar with Foundation, you might <a href="https://www.codementor.io/css/tutorial/bootstrap-3-vs-foundation-5-front-end-framework-comparison">read this comparison</a> (note that it references the slightly older version of Foundation 5, but is substantially the same for the article's proposes).</p></dd>
    <dt>SASS:</dt>
      <dd><p>We have not used Foundation's compilable CSS, nor have we added any other compile required tooling. This was done to keep implementation as simple as possible, and it offered limited benefits. However, we have implement the vanilla release of Foundation, so there's no reason you couldn't swap that out. As internal users become more familiar with Foundation and we further optimise, a future release may use SASS.</p></dd>
    <dt>Animation:</dt>
      <dd><p>Using CSS3 and JavaScript animations there are many opportunities to make our sites look good and function better, but we want to take this one step at a time and get other items in order. Currently on target for v1.5. <span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip" data-disable-hover='false' tabindex=1 title="Foundation does have a complementary animation toolset that we've not bundled, but you could...">Feel free to experiment with subtle animations</span>, let us know if you do.</p></dd>
